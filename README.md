# Pig-game
Objective:
The objective of the Pig game is to reach a specific number of points, usually 100.

Equipment:
2 standard six-sided dice
Score sheet or scoring system
Basic Rules:
The game begins with a player rolling the dice. This player becomes the "active player."
The active player rolls the dice and adds the points on the faces of the rolled dice to their current score.
If the player rolls a 1 on any of the dice, they lose all points gained in that round and their turn ends.
If they roll any other combination of points, they can choose to either continue rolling the dice to increase their score or pass the dice to the next player.
If the player chooses to stop and save their points, they are added to their total score, and the next player becomes the active player.
The game continues in this manner until a player accumulates 100 points to win the game.
